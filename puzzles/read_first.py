# Python has two different ways to write comments.

# The first way is to use the hash character (#) at the beginning of a line.
# The second way is to use triple quotes (""") at the beginning and end of a block of text.

# In these puzzle files, I will use both forms of comments, but in different ways.
# In programming, we would call this a "convention".

# When you see a comment like this one, that is preceeded by a hash character (#),
# you will know that it is instructions that you should read and follow.

# Comments that are preceeded by triple quotes (""") are meant to be copy/pasted into
# ChatGPT. Do this now with the next comment. Quotes can be included or not.

"""What is a programming convention?"""

# Now you are ready to start the first puzzle! 

# In the same directory as this file, you will find a file called "1.hello_world.py".
# Open that file and read the instructions there.
