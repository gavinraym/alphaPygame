# In this file, you will be building a simple bot
# that gives a greeting and asks for your name.
# It then responds with a longer greeting using your name.

# ChatGPT will remember the questions that you ask, as long as you are in the same chat.
# First, create a new chat with ChatGPT that will be specifically about this puzzle.
# Then, copy/paste the following comment into the chat window.
"""I am learning how to program in Python. Will you help me understand some simple concepts?"""
# Good! Now ChatGPT will have some context for the questions in this puzzle.


## Step 1: Print a greeting
"""How do I print a string in Python?"""
## Write code that displays a message, like "Hello, world!"
## ADD YOUR CODE HERE ##

## Additional learning prompts if you want to know more:
"""What is a string?"""
"""What are the most commonly used builtin python functions?"""

## Run your code to ensure your greeting is displayed
# If you don't know how to run a Python file, you should ask ChatGPT for help.
"""How do I run a python file in Visual Studio Code?"""


## Step 2: Ask for the user's name
"""How do I receive input from the user in Python?"""
## Write code that asks the user for their name, and stores it in a variable.
## ADD YOUR CODE HERE ##

## Additional learning prompts if you want to know more:
"""What is a variable?"""

## Run your code to ensure the user is asked for their name


## Step 3: Print a longer greeting using the person's name
"""How do I print 'hello name, how are you?' with a variable name?"""
## Write code that displays a message using the variable
## you created in the previous step.
## ADD YOUR CODE HERE ##

## additional learning prompts if you want to know more:
"""What is a string concatenation?"""

## Run your code to ensure everything works as expected
