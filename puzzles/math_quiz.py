# Ut oh, did someone say 'Math Quiz'?!?!

# In this puzzle, you will be building a simple math quiz game.
# You will ask the user a series of math questions, and compare
# their answers to the correct answers. If they get the answer right,
# you will congratulate them and add a point to their score. If they
# get the answer wrong, you will let them know and move on to the next.

# Let's get a new ChatGPT chat going for this puzzle. Start a new chat, 
# and ask it these prompts. Review what it says before moving on.
"""I am building a simple python game that asks users math questions. Will you help me?"""


## Step 1: Start by welcoming the user to the game and explaining the rules. 
## If you can't remember how to print a string in Python, ask ChatGPT for help.
"""How do I print a string?"""
# For example, you can explain that the game will ask them a series of math questions, 
# and they need to answer as many as they can correctly.

## Additional learning prompts if you want to know more:
"""How do I print multiple lines in Python?"""
"""How do I print colored text in Python?"""

## Run your code to ensure the welcome message is displayed


## Step 2: Create a 'score' variable to keep track of the user's score.
## Set it's value to 0 to start.
"""How do I create a variable in Python?"""
## ADD YOUR CODE HERE ##

## Additional learning prompts if you want to know more:
"""What are Python data types?"""
"""What type is the variable 'score=0'?"""


## Step 3: Ask the user if they are ready to play the game.
"""Can I use input() without capturing the returned value?"""
## ADD YOUR CODE HERE ##

## Run your code to ensure the user is asked if they are ready to play the game.


## Step 4: Display the first question and prompt the user for an answer. Save
## the user's answer into a variable.
## ADD YOUR CODE HERE ##

## Run your code to ensure the first question is displayed and the user is prompted for an answer.


## Step 5: Use an if/else statement to check the user's answer and see if it is correct.
## If it is correct, congratulate them and add a point to their score. If it is incorrect,
## let them know and move on to the next question.
"""How do I use an if/else statement in Python?"""
"""How do I check if an input is equal to a number?"""
"""Does 14=="14"?"""
"""How do I increase a score variable by 1?"""
## ADD YOUR CODE HERE ##

## Run your code to ensure the user's answer is checked and the score is updated.


## Step 6: Display the user's score.
## ADD YOUR CODE HERE ##

## Run your code to ensure the user's score is displayed.


## Step 7: Create a second question by repeating steps 4, 5, and 6.
## ADD YOUR CODE HERE ##

## Additional learning prompts if you want to know more:
"""How can I use a function to reduce code duplication?"""

## Run your code to ensure the second question is displayed and the user is prompted for an answer.


## Step 7: Create a third question by repeating steps 4, 5, and 6.
## ADD YOUR CODE HERE ##

## Run your code to ensure the third question is displayed and the user is prompted for an answer.



## Step 8: At the end of the game, use print to display the user's score and congratulate them on 
## their performance. For example, you can say "You got 2 out of 3 questions correct. Great job!"
## For an added challenge, add different messages based on the user's score.
## ADD YOUR CODE HERE ##

## Run your code to ensure the user's score is displayed and they are congratulated on their performance.
